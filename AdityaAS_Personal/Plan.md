## Searching for Patterns
* Set1 - Naive Pattern Search
* Set2 - KMP Algorithm
* Set3 - Rabin Karp Algorithm
* Set4 - Naive Pattern Search - Improvised
* Set5 - Finite Automata
* Set6 - Finite Automata - Efficient Construction
* Set7a - Boyer-Moore Algorithm (Bad Character Heuristic)
* Set7b - Boyer-Moore Algorithm (Good Suffix Heuristic)
* Set8 - Suffix Tree Introduction

## Suffix Tree - Applications
1) Pattern Searching

2) Finding the longest repeated substring

3) Finding the longest common substring

4) Finding the longest palindrome in a string

5) Links to problems - [Quora_answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-good-sources-to-understand-suffix-tree-suffix-array-and-their-implementation)

6) Linear Time Suffix Tree Construction - Ukkonen's Suffix Tree Construction

## Suffix Array
1) Construction and Implementation of Suffix Array

2) Solve all problems to be solved by Suffix Tree also using Suffix Array approach
